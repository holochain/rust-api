The `define_zome` macro has 3 general parts: 1. entries: an array of ValidatingEntryType as returned by using the entry macro 2. genesis: `genesis` is a callback called by Holochain to every Zome implemented within a DNA.      It gets called when a new agent is initializing an instance of the DNA for the first time, and     should return `Ok` or an `Err`, depending on whether the agent can join the network or not. 3. functions: `functions` is divided up into `capabilities`, which specify who can access those functions.     `functions` must be a tree structure where the first children are `capabilities`     and the children of those `capabilities` are actual function definitions. # Examples"],["entry","The `entry` macro is a helper for creating `ValidatingEntryType` definitions for use within the define_zome macro. It has 6 component parts: 1. name: `name` is simply the descriptive name of the entry type, such as \"post\", or \"user\".      It is what must be given as the `entry_type_name` argument when calling `commit_entry` and the other data read/write functions. 2. description: `description` is something that is primarily for human readers of your code, just describe this entry type 3. sharing: `sharing` defines what distribution over the DHT, or not, occurs with entries of this type, possible values      are defined in the Sharing enum 4. native_type: `native_type` references a given Rust struct, which provides a clear schema for entries of this type. 5. validation_package: `validation_package` is a special identifier, which declares which data is required from peers      when attempting to validate entries of this type.      Possible values are found within ValidationPackageDefinition 6. validation: `validation` is a callback function which will be called any time that a       source chain action is taken relating to this entry type, such as `commit_entry`, `update_entry`, `remove_entry`.      It always expects two arguments, the first of which is the entry attempting to be validated,      the second is the validation `context`, which offers a variety of metadata useful for validation. # Examples The following is a standalone Rust file that exports a function which can be called to get a `ValidatingEntryType` of a \"post\". ```rust use boolinator::*; use hdk::{   self,   entry_definition::ValidatingEntryType,   holochain_dna::zome::entry_types::Sharing }; use serde_json;"]],"mod":[["entry_definition",""],["error",""],["global_fns",""],["globals","Holds the internal/private globals used by the zome api library.
